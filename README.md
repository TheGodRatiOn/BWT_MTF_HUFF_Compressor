# BWT_MTF_HUFF_Compressor
Text data compressor based on combination of BWT and MTF algorythms with Huffman encoding

java version - 11

command line interface parameters: 
<input filename/filepath> <output filename/filepath>

It is recommended to change input encoder buffer size for your needs, 
hence efficiency of compression is increasing along with it,
but it comes with a cost of performance.
